### Project Title: Used Car Price Prediction 

#### Project Description

This project focuses on building a predictive model to accurately estimate the retail price of used General Motors (GM) cars. By analyzing a dataset of over eight hundred vehicles, I developed a comprehensive linear model to help potential buyers and sellers better understand the factors influencing a car's market value. The analysis revealed that a combination of continuous and categorical features can predict a car's price with a high degree of accuracy.


#### Business Question

> "What are the key vehicle features and metrics that most significantly impact the retail price of used General Motors (GM) cars in excellent condition?"


#### Data Analysis & Methology

* **Data Source:** This project uses a dataset of over eight hundred used GM cars from 2005. The data was originally sourced from the **2005 Central Edition of Kelly Blue Book,** which is highly reputable resource for vehicle evaluation. A key assumption of this analysis is that all cars in the dataset were less than one year old and considered to be in **"excellent condition.**"

* **Dataset Overview:** The dataset includes the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Price** | Suggested retail price in excellent condition. |
| **Mileage** | Number of miles the car has been driven. |
| **Make** | Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Saturn, Pontiac, Chevrolet). |
| **Model** | Specific car model (e.g., Ion, Vibe, Cavalier). |
| **Trim** | Specific model variant (e.g., SE Sedan 4D). |
| **Type** | Body type (e.g., sedan, coupe). |
| **Cylinder** | Number of cylinders in the engine. |
| **Liter** | Engine size. |
| **Doors** | Number of doors. |
| **Cruise** | `1` if the car has cruise control, `0` otherwise. |
| **Sound** | `1` if the car has upgraded speakers, `0` otherwise. |
| **Leather** | `1` if the car has leather seats, `0` otherwise. |

* **Data Context:** This dataset represents a specific, curated snapshot of the used car market in 2005. It's crucial to acknowledge the **assumptions and limitations** of this data, specifically that all vehicles were less than one year old and in **"excellent condition.**" Therefore, the findings of this analysis are most relevant to understanding the **pricing of well-maintained, late-model GM vehicles** and may not generalize to older or less-maintained cars. The data also doesn't account for geographical location, which can significantly impact car prices.
