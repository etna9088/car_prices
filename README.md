## Project Title: Used Car Price Prediction 

This project focuses on building a predictive model to accurately estimate the retail price of used General Motors (GM) cars. By analyzing a dataset of over eight hundred vehicles, I developed a comprehensive linear model to help potential buyers and sellers better understand the factors influencing a car's market value. The analysis revealed that a combination of continuous and categorical features can predict a car's price with a high degree of accuracy.

### Dataset Overview

This project uses a dataset of over eight hundred used GM cars from 2005. The data was originally sourced from the **2005 Central Edition of the Kelly Blue Book**, which is a highly reputable resource for vehicle valuation. A key assumption of this analysis is that all cars in the dataset were less than one year old and considered to be in **"excellent condition."**

The dataset includes the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Price** | Suggested retail price in excellent condition. |
| **Mileage** | Number of miles the car has been driven. |
| **Make** | Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Saturn, Pontiac, Chevrolet). |
| **Model** | Specific car model (e.g., Ion, Vibe, Cavalier). |
| **Trim** | Specific model variant (e.g., SE Sedan 4D). |
| **Type** | Body type (e.g., sedan, coupe). |
| **Cylinder** | Number of cylinders in the engine. |
| **Liter** | Engine size. |
| **Doors** | Number of doors. |
| **Cruise** | `1` if the car has cruise control, `0` otherwise. |
| **Sound** | `1` if the car has upgraded speakers, `0` otherwise. |
| **Leather** | `1` if the car has leather seats, `0` otherwise. |
